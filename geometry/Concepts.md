## Mathematics

* [Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry) studie the size, shapes, positions and dimensions of things. We can only see or make shapes that are flat (2D) or solid (3D), but mathematicians (people who study math) are able to study shapes that are 4D, 5D, 6D, and so on.

  * [Bravis lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravais_lattice)
  * [Crystallography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallography)
  * [Quasicrystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasicrystal)

* [Trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry) is a part of elementary mathematics dealing with angles, triangles and trigonometric functions such as sine (abbreviated _sin_), cosine (abbreviated _cos_) and tangent (abbreviated _tan_).

* [Topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology) studies how spaces are organized and how they are structured in terms of position. It also studies how spaces are connected. It is divided into algebraic topology, differential topology and geometric topology.

  * [Topological skeleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_skeleton)

* [Fractal geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) studies self-similar Euclidean spaces whose fractal dimensions strictly exceed their topological dimension.

  * [Julia set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set)
  * [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)
  * [Fatou set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatou_set)
  * [Iterated function systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system)

* [Pattern formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_formation) studies the statistically predictable effects of self-organizational behaviors observed in nature and the common principles that bound them.
