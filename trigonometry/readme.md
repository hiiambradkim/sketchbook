# Trigonometry

> *Trigonometry*: The branch of mathemtics that deals with angles, sides and functions of triangles.

Whereas geometry was the height of my STEM education, trigonometry was the beginning of my declining interest in mathematics. 

At the time, studying triangles in terms of equations seemed unreasonably technical and superflous, although I do clearly recall the teacher reminding us that understanding trigonometry will always pay off, one way or another. 

# Objective

## Functions

The three most common trigonometric functions are sine, cosine and tangent, followed by their reciprocal functions, cotangent, secant and cosecant.
