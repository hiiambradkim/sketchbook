	<h1>Pi visualisation</h1>
	<p>This diagram represents the first 1500 digits of pi. The digits are represented as a path traced by links between successive digits.</p>
	<p>Each digit is assigned a segment around the circle. The "14" in "3.14..." is drawn as a link between <span class="segment1">segment 1</span> and <span class="segment4">segment 4</span>.</p>
	<p>The position of the link on a digit's segment is associated with the position of pi. For example, the "14" link associated with the 2nd digit (1) and the 3rd digit (4) is drawn from position 2 on <span class="segment1">segment 1</span> to position 3 on <span class="segment4">segment 4</span>.</p>
